    "Many people in the United States try to make a better life for themselves. This often implies to get a better education and get a degree in order to compete in the job market. Attending a Universtity is a way for teenagers to enter a program that trains them for a certain profession. It is no wonder why most teenageers are matriculated into a university in hopes of obtaining a job once their studies conclude.   However, university/college tuition in the United States is not free, and it's no surprise that the cost of a degree has changed. This leads us to our question,\n",
    " * how much has tuition changed over the years since [INSERT YEAR HERE], with respect to the avarege income.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This question is important to us for different reasons. One being that everyone involved in this project comes from low income families, and is currently attending one of the most expensive public schools. We were wondering how much the tuition has changed. At  the same time, we were able to find datasets for 2 decades from the Department of Education. The reason why this was important to us is because we have recently experienced an increase in tuition, and this is worrisome because there are still other materials (books, writing utensils, etc.) that aren't accounted for in our tuition.\n",
    "\tBased on New York Times, the tuitions and fees have increased about $155 for a four year public school, and it reaches an average of $3000 per a year. Now if we compare that price to todayâ€™s cost of attendance, we will see a massive gap in price range. Now in terms of financial aid, based on the College Board Organization, an undergraduate student used to get financial aid that covers all his/her tution, and in fact he/she was able to save some of it. Now this is not the case because tution seems to be increasing more as the years pass.\n"

We understand that some of the information must be kept private because it involves personal details about certain individuals. We looked at several data sets that involved zip codes and city names; we were prepared to clean these variables, but we felt the dataset was insufficient, so it was not used. The current data we used contained state names, and though state names are not a huge privacy issue, we decided to leave them out since they weren't necessary for our data conclusion. Other than that, the data we used contained only numbers. Moreover, these numbers were income values that were used during our data analysis."
